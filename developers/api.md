# Archivist API

 Archivist uses REST API to interact with the node and we can use HTTP client for interaction and configuration.

 API specification can be found on the [api.archivist.storage](https://api.archivist.storage) and it is generated based on [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/durability-labs/archivist-node/blob/main/openapi.yaml). We also generate a [Postman Collection](https://api.archivist.storage/postman.json).
